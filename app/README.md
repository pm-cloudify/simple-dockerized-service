# Frontend App

This is a simple frontend application.

Used for practicing ci/cd.

### What should I do?

#### 1 - you can develop your app locally using following cmd:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 2 - then to be able to scale this app we should dockerize it:

```bash
docker build -t my-frontend-app .
```

#### 3 - decide where to use this image :)
